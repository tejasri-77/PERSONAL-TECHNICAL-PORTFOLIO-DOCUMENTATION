        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            A Heart Rate Sensor using IoT is a smart and innovative device designed to monitor an individual's heart rate in real-time 
            and transmit the data to a connected platform, typically a smartphone or a cloud-based application. This IoT-based solution 
            allows users to track their heart rate continuously, enabling timely interventions and health insights. 
            The sensor is compact and wearable, making it convenient for users to monitor their heart health on-the-go.
