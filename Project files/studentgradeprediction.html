        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>
            The Student Grade Prediction System using AI is an intelligent application designed to analyze historical academic data 
            and predict a student's future grades. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system takes into account various 
            factors like previous exam scores, attendance, study habits, and other academic metrics to generate accurate predictions.
             By providing early insights into a student's performance, educators can identify struggling students and implement 
             personalized interventions to improve their academic outcomes. This AI-driven system aids in fostering a proactive and 
             data-driven approach to enhance educationalÂ success.

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Data Collection and Preprocessing: The system collects and preprocesses academic data from students,
                 including exam scores, attendance records, coursework grades, and extracurricular activities.


            </li>
            <li>
                Machine Learning Models: AI algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks are trained on the 
                prepared dataset to build accurate prediction models.

            </li>
            <li>
                Performance Analytics: The system performs model evaluation and validation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error 
                (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure prediction accuracy.

            </li>
            <li>
                Personalized Recommendations: Based on predicted grades and historical data, the system can suggest personalized
                 study plans and learning resources for individual students.

            </li>
            <li>
                Real-time Updates: As new data becomes available, the system continuously updates and refines the prediction 
                models to improve accuracy.

            </li>
            <li>
                Visualization: The system may use data visualization techniques to represent grade trends, helping educators and
                 students comprehend their academic progress effectively.
